# Eazzy Afia

Eazzy Afya is a WhatsApp and web based chatbot application aiming to help people find Equity Afia clinics and services offered with ease

## Inspiration 💡

Equity Afya is a health care wing of Equity Bank that offers affordable health services to Kenyans. They have a network of clinics across the country that offer a wide range of services. However, the wing has not been able to reach out to all the people who need their services. We wanted to create a platform that would help people find the nearest Equity Afya clinic and the services offered with ease.

## What it does 🤖

Eazzy Afya is a WhatsApp and web based chatbot application that helps people find Equity Afya clinics and services offered with ease. The application is able to locate the nearest clinic to the user and also provide information on the services offered at the clinic. The application also allows users to book appointments with the clinics.

## How we built it 🛠

We built the application using the following technologies:

- Python
